## � Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
- **CustomTkinter**: Modern UI framework
- **OpenCV**: Camera capture and image processing
- **MediaPipe**: AI-powered pose detection
- **Pillow**: Image manipulation
- **Plyer**: Cross-platform notifications
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations

### Posture Detection Algorithm
- Analyzes key body landmarks (shoulders, ears, nose)
- Calculates neck angle for forward head posture
- Measures shoulder slope for slouching detection
- Provides confidence scoring for reliable detection

### Performance Optimizations
- ~30 FPS processing with threading
- Efficient frame resizing and display
- Configurable detection sensitivity
- Smart alert cooldown system

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Launch the app**: Run `python sitsense.py`
2. **Grant camera permission** when prompted
3. **Click "Start Monitoring"** to begin posture detection
4. **Sit naturally** in front of your camera
5. **Receive alerts** when poor posture is detected
6. **Adjust settings** using the Settings button

## 🔧 Posture Detection Details

SitSense analyzes several key indicators:

- **Head Forward Posture**: Detects when your head is too far forward
- **Neck Angle**: Monitors the angle between your head and shoulders (threshold: 160°)
- **Shoulder Alignment**: Checks for slouching based on shoulder position
- **Distance from Screen**: Alerts when you're leaning too close

## ⚙️ Configuration & Settings

### In-App Settings
- **Alert Cooldown**: Set time between posture alerts (default: 30 seconds)
- **Detection Sensitivity**: Adjust how strict the posture detection is
- **Notification Style**: Choose between desktop notifications and in-app alerts

### Configuration File (`config.json`)
```json
{
    "alert_cooldown": 30,
    "detection_confidence": 0.5,
    "posture_thresholds": {
        "neck_angle_min": 160,
        "shoulder_slope_max": 0.05,
        "head_forward_threshold": 0.02
    },
    "ui_settings": {
        "window_width": 600,
        "window_height": 700
    }
}
```
